# Firewall-Configuration-Task

This repository contains my work for the Cyber Security Internship Task 4.
I configured and tested firewall rules on Windows using PowerShell to block inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet) and then removed the rule.

The report file details the commands used and summarizes the firewallâ€™s role in network security.
